The .ipynb file shows the code for the project. The folium map might not show the maps in the github web view, that is why

"tax_data.csv" is the dataset of taxi ranks showing the pickup point in longitude, lattitude and street address.

K-means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN and hybrid model of HDBSCAN have been demonstrated and the parameters and explanations have been written in the
write up .pdf sent in email.
