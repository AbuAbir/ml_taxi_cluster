The .ipynb file shows the code for the project. The folium map might not show the maps in the github web view, that is why
I mentioned the .pdf file to show how the map looks like with different cluster numbers when clicked. 
"tax_data.csv" is the dataset of taxi ranks showing the pickup point in longitude, lattitude and street address.

When running the .ipynb file, two .html file would be generated so that you can see the customized map in later time. "hybrid.html" is one of them.
